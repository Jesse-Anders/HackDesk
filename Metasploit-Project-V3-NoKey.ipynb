    "This is the final version of the HackDesk to be submitted for the Deep Learning fall semester class. This version includes various upgrades from its predecessors, and is able to search all 2437 exploits in metaspoit scraped files. The exploits were pythonically formated to have headers and footers and were also pythonically pruned to include only the most relevant data for the models purposes. lastly, the data was converted to a PDF file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Novel approaches in Hackdesk V3\n",
    "1. V3 upgrades the LLM from ChatGPT 3.5 to ChatGPT4o-mini. Required New Dedicated Python Environment.\n",
    "2. V3 utilizes a PDF search tool to search the entire list of expoits rather than submitting a truncated list of exploits as a RAG document.\n",
    "3. In addition to the 'inquiry' variable, V3 introduces a 'target' user variable, which allows the user to focus the search space for the CrewAI PDF Search tool.\n",
    "4. Increased Verbose level hyperparameter improves model performance over previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements\n",
    "1. The HackDesk V3 is now able to search the entire set of possible exploits rather than just a short list in a rag document.\n",
    "2. The results, while limited, are often very accurate and what can be called 'correct solutions' to user requests.\n",
    "3. Results usually include the correct exploit name, number and description.\n",
    "4. Improved Prompting - Prompts, Agent Roles, and Agent Tasks have been dramatically altered to achieve better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Persistent Failure - Exploit Count\n",
    "There is one overarching failure; the HackDesk V3 natuarally only ever returns 2 or 3 results from the PDF search, regardless if there are many more pertanent exploits. This limitation is very stuborn and can only be overcome if extremely explicit instructions require a specific number of exploits, such as \"you must provide a minimum of 10 exploits.\" Unfortunately this work around can force this system to hallucinate answers if the explicit given number is higher than the actual number of exploits in the searched document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "It is very possible that the search count limitation can be overcome through chunking and vectorizing the data set of exploits. This is a standard procedure from using webscapers in tandem with LLM's and should be the next avenue of exploration.\n",
